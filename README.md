# WordGuessGame

This JavaScript program implements the word guessing game. The game selects a random word from a word list and has the user guess that word.

How does it work?

1. Starting a New Game: When the program starts, a random word is selected and a new game is started for the user to guess.

2. Word Input: The user interacts with a text input box where he enters letter predictions.

3. Prediction Check: Each letter entered by the user is processed as a correct guess if it is included in the selected word. If the letter is not in the word, the user's guess is considered wrong and the number of errors increases.

4. Game Status Control: User's predictions and errors are tracked. The game ends when the user guesses the word completely correctly or reaches the maximum number of errors.

5. Restart and Hint: User can click on the corresponding buttons to start a new game or to see the hint.
